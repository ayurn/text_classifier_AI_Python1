this movie is fantastic,each and every actor did great job and its great ending for marvel era.
A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans. So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! 
We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important. Just enjoy!
